<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Emirhan. I am 22 years old and living in İzmir/Turkey. I was born on March 5, 2002.
  Also I am 3rd year student in the department of Business Administration at Hacettepe University in Ankara.
  My mother name is Nazlı and my father name is Vezir and I have 1 siblings named Ekin.

<p>My first goal in the name of my jobtime is doing a job that i love and enjoy. This is really important for me because
  i am studying Business administration right now as i said but i realized this is not me. I do not enjoy doing that a
  administration kind of thing but i am really enjoying coding/programming something because i am very familiar with
  computer and technology due to my childhood hobies.</p>
